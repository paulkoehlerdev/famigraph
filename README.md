# Famigraph

Famigraph is an innovative project that maps connections within a community while preserving anonymity. It leverages FIDO2-enabled keys for identification and allows users to build their network by scanning QR codes or sharing their own.

## Features
- **Anonymous Connections**: Establish and maintain connections without compromising your identity.
- **FIDO2 Authentication**: Secure and reliable identification using FIDO2-enabled keys.
- **QR Code Integration**: Connect easily by scanning or sharing QR codes.
- **Public Graph (Coming Soon)**: A visual representation of community connections will be available in the near future.

## Current Status

Famigraph is still under active development. While the core functionalities are operational, you may encounter occasional bugs or unexpected behavior. We appreciate your patience and support as we work to improve the platform.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A FIDO2-enabled key for identification.
- A device with a camera (for scanning QR codes).

### Usage
1. Register your FIDO2-enabled key with the application.
2. Scan QR codes or share your QR code to establish connections.
3. Explore your network (and soon the public graph!)
